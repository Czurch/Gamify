Set Up Your PostgreSQL Database:
[X] - Install PostgreSQL on your server or locally.
[X] - Create a new database for your project.
[X] - Set up the necessary tables to store data (e.g., "users" table for user profiles).

Create Your GraphQL Schema:
[] - Define your GraphQL schema using GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language). This defines the types, queries, and mutations your API will support.

Set Up Apollo Server:
[X] - Install the necessary dependencies (apollo-server, pg, etc.).
[X] - Create an Apollo Server instance, connecting it to your PostgreSQL database.
[X] - Use your GraphQL schema in the Apollo Server configuration.

Define Resolvers:
[] - Write resolver functions for each field in your schema.
[] - Resolvers are responsible for fetching and manipulating data from your PostgreSQL database.

Implement Authentication and Authorization:
[] - Choose an authentication method (JWT, OAuth, etc.) and integrate it with Apollo Server.
[] - Implement authorization logic to restrict access to certain data and operations.

Test Your GraphQL API:
[] - Use tools like Apollo Studio, GraphQL Playground, or Postman to test your API endpoints and queries.




FOR FRONTEND WHEN READY:

Example Frontend Query for User Profile:
Let's say you want to request a user's profile using GraphQL from your React Native frontend.

Install Dependencies:

Install the necessary packages: @apollo/client for GraphQL client in React Native.
Set Up Apollo Client:

Create an instance of ApolloClient and set the URI to your GraphQL server.
`
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'YOUR_GRAPHQL_SERVER_URL',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
`
Write the GraphQL Query in Your Frontend:
Assuming you have a query named GET_USER_PROFILE in your GraphQL schema:

`
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

import { GET_USER_PROFILE } from './yourQueryPath';

function UserProfile() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_USER_PROFILE);

  if (loading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  if (error) return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;

  const user = data.getUserProfile; // Assuming this is the field returned by the query

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Name: {user.name}</Text>
      <Text>Email: {user.email}</Text>
      {/* Other user profile details */}
    </View>
  );
}

export default UserProfile;
`
Define the GraphQL Query:
In a separate file, define your GraphQL query using the gql template tag:

`
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

export const GET_USER_PROFILE = gql`
  query GetUserProfile {
    getUserProfile {
      id
      name
      email
      // Other user profile fields
    }
  }
`;
`
Remember that the query structure should match the structure of your backend's GraphQL schema.

This example gives you a basic outline of how to set up your frontend to request a user profile using
 GraphQL. You can expand on this by adding error handling, loading indicators, and more complex 
 queries and mutations as needed for your application.
